**1. Roles of the Crown and the Houses of Parliament (Victorian and Commonwealth)**

*   **Purpose:** Parliament is the supreme law-making body within its jurisdiction. It consists of the Crown's representative and two houses.
*   **Commonwealth Parliament:** Consists of the King (represented by the Governor-General), the Senate (upper house), and the House of Representatives (lower house).
    *   **House of Representatives (Lower House):** Sometimes called the 'people's house' or the 'house of government'. It is comprised of 151 members representing electorates across Australia.
        *   **Key Roles:**
            *   Initiate and make laws. Most new laws are initiated here, usually by the government.
            *   Determine the government. The party with the majority of members forms government.
            *   Represent the people. Members are elected to represent their electorates and should reflect their views.
            *   Scrutinise government administration. Includes questioning ministers.
            *   Act as a house of review. Reviews bills initiated in the Senate.
            *   Control government expenditure. Only the lower house can initiate money bills (taxation and appropriation).
    *   **Senate (Upper House):** Often referred to as the 'states' house' or the house of review. It has 76 elected members (12 from each state, 2 from each territory), elected for six years. It is designed for equal representation of states.
        *   **Key Roles:**
            *   Review laws from the House of Representatives. This is its primary role. It can amend or reject bills.
            *   Allow for equal representation of the states.
            *   Scrutinise bills and government administration. Often done through committees.
            *   Initiate and pass bills (except money bills).
*   **Victorian Parliament:** Consists of the King (represented by the Governor), the Legislative Council (upper house), and the Legislative Assembly (lower house).
    *   **Legislative Assembly (Lower House):** Comprised of 88 members representing electoral districts. The party with the majority forms the Victorian government.
        *   **Key Roles:**
            *   Initiate and pass bills. Most new legislation starts here.
            *   Form government.
            *   Represent the people. Members represent the interests of their districts.
            *   Act as a house of review. Reviews bills from the Legislative Council.
            *   Control government expenditure. Initiates financial spending legislation (the Budget).
            *   Scrutinise government administration.
    *   **Legislative Council (Upper House):** Primarily acts as a 'house of review'. Has 40 elected members representing eight regions.
        *   **Key Roles:**
            *   Act as a house of review. Reviews bills from the Legislative Assembly. It can amend or reject bills (except appropriation/money bills).
            *   Scrutinise government administration.
            *   Initiate and pass bills. Bills can start here, but most start in the Assembly.
*   **The Crown (Governor-General Federally, Governor in Victoria):** The British monarch is part of the system, represented by the Governor-General and state Governors. They act on the advice of the government.
    *   **Key Roles in Law-Making:**
        *   Grant royal assent. This is the formal signing and approval of a bill after it has passed both houses, making it an Act of Parliament. It is required for a bill to become law.
        *   Withholding royal assent. The power to refuse approval, which is rare.
        *   Appointing the Executive Council. This council (leader of government, ministers) advises the Crown's representative and approves secondary legislation.

**2. The Division of Law-making Powers**

*   The Australian Constitution divides law-making powers between the Commonwealth and state parliaments. This division aims to distribute responsibilities and safeguard against abuse of power.
*   **Exclusive Powers:** Powers that can only be exercised by the Commonwealth Parliament. State parliaments cannot legislate in these areas. These are granted by sections 51 and 52 of the Constitution, or made exclusive by other sections or by their nature.
    *   Examples: Currency, defence, customs and border protection, foreign affairs, overseas trade.
*   **Concurrent Powers:** Powers shared by both the Commonwealth and state parliaments. Both can make laws in these areas. These are listed in section 51 of the Constitution.
    *   Examples: Taxation, marriage and divorce, trade, postal/telegraphic/telephonic services. Conflicts between state and Commonwealth laws in these areas are resolved by section 109.
*   **Residual Powers:** Powers that were left with the states at Federation and are not listed in the Constitution. The Commonwealth Parliament has no authority to make laws in these areas.
    *   Examples: Criminal law, education, public transport, medical procedures, road laws, agriculture, police, prisons. Residual powers mean laws can differ between states.

**3. Significance of Section 109**

*   **Purpose:** Section 109 resolves conflicts between state and Commonwealth laws in areas of concurrent power.
*   **Mechanism:** If a state law is inconsistent with a Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth law prevails, and the state law is invalid *to the extent of the inconsistency*. Only the inconsistent sections of the state law are invalid; other sections remain in force.
*   **Significance:**
    *   It provides a way to resolve inconsistencies between state and Commonwealth legislation.
    *   It **restricts the law-making powers of the states** in areas where the Commonwealth has also legislated. States recognise this constraint when making laws in concurrent areas.
    *   It provides a common approach for resolving conflicts.
*   **Limitations:** Section 109 does not automatically invalidate state laws; the law needs to be **challenged in court** for the inconsistency to be determined and the state law declared invalid. If the conflicting Commonwealth law is changed or removed, the invalid part of the state law may become valid again.
*   **Example:** *McBain v Victoria (2000)* is a significant case where the High Court used section 109 to invalidate a section of the Victorian *Infertility Treatment Act 1995* that was inconsistent with the Commonwealth *Sex Discrimination Act 1984*, allowing single women access to IVF treatment.

**4. Means by which the Australian Constitution Acts as a Check on Parliament**

*   The Constitution establishes structures and principles that limit Parliament's law-making power to prevent abuse.
*   **The Bicameral Structure:** The requirement for two houses (House of Representatives/Senate federally, Legislative Assembly/Legislative Council in Victoria).
    *   **How it Checks:** The upper house acts as a **house of review** for bills passed by the lower house. This allows for scrutiny, debate, and potential amendments, improving the quality of laws. This check is particularly effective with a **'hostile upper house'**, where the government doesn't have a majority and needs crossbench support, increasing scrutiny. A deadlock between houses can also limit government legislative power.
    *   **Limitations:** If the government holds a **majority in the upper house ('rubber stamp' upper house)**, bills may pass with little scrutiny or debate. A hostile upper house can also cause delays and negotiations based on minority interests.
*   **The Separation of Powers:** The Constitution divides powers into legislative (parliament makes laws), executive (administers laws), and judicial (courts apply laws and resolve disputes).
    *   **How it Checks:** Aims to prevent the abuse of power by ensuring no single body holds all three powers. The **independent judiciary (High Court)** can act as a check by interpreting laws and the Constitution and declaring laws made beyond Parliament's power (ultra vires) invalid. The legislature can also scrutinise the executive through processes like Question Time.
    *   **Limitations:** There is an **overlap between the legislative and executive** branches in practice, as ministers are part of both Cabinet (executive) and Parliament (legislature). Judges are appointed by the executive, potentially influencing the judiciary's composition. The separation is constitutionally entrenched only at the federal level, although the principle is generally followed at the state level.
*   **Express Protection of Rights:** The Constitution explicitly protects five specific rights that are entrenched and can only be changed by a referendum (section 128).
    *   **How it Checks:** These entrenched rights directly **limit Parliament's law-making power**, preventing them from making laws that infringe upon these specific rights. They are legally enforceable; individuals can challenge laws potentially breaching these rights in the High Court, which can declare them invalid.
    *   **Limitations:** Only a **limited number of rights** are expressly protected (five). Some rights have **limited scope** and may not apply to state laws or all situations (e.g., s80 jury trial only for Commonwealth indictable offences). Changing or adding rights via referendum is very difficult and costly. Enforcing these rights through the High Court can be costly and time-consuming, requiring standing.
*   **Role of the High Court in Protecting Representative Government:** Sections 7 and 24 require Parliament to be 'directly chosen by the people', establishing representative government.
    *   **How it Checks:** The High Court interprets sections 7 and 24 and can declare laws invalid if they infringe upon this principle. This includes recognizing implied rights necessary for representative government, such as the **implied freedom of political communication**.
    *   **Example:** *Roach v Electoral Commissioner (2007)* is a key case where the High Court held that a complete ban on prisoners voting was unconstitutional as it infringed upon the principle of representative government under sections 7 and 24.
    *   **Limitations:** The High Court can only act when a case is brought before it. Litigation is costly and time-consuming and requires standing. Judges are not elected, which some view as undemocratic.

**5. High Court Cases Impacting Law-making Powers**

*   The High Court interprets the Constitution and its decisions can impact the division of law-making powers between the Commonwealth and states.
*   **R v Brislan; Ex parte Williams (1935):**
    *   **Issue:** Interpretation of 'other like services' in section 51(v) (postal, telegraphic, telephonic powers).
    *   **Decision:** The High Court interpreted 'other like services' to include radio broadcasting.
    *   **Impact/Significance:** This decision broadened the Commonwealth's law-making power and resulted in a shift of power to the Commonwealth in the area of communications. This interpretation has influenced the Commonwealth's assumption of power to legislate over new technologies like television and potentially the internet.
    *   **Limitations:** The decision doesn't automatically extend to *all* new technologies without further cases.
*   **Commonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam case) (1983):**
    *   **Issue:** Interpretation of the 'external affairs' power in section 51(xxix). Could the Commonwealth use this power to legislate on a residual matter (dam construction) to implement a treaty obligation (World Heritage Convention)?.
    *   **Decision:** The High Court held that the external affairs power allows the Commonwealth to legislate to fulfil genuine international treaty obligations, even if the subject matter is typically a state residual power. This meant the Commonwealth law prevailed over the inconsistent state law under section 109.
    *   **Impact/Significance:** This resulted in a significant **shift in the division of law-making powers from the states to the Commonwealth**. The Commonwealth gained the ability to legislate on areas covered by international treaties, potentially extending to human rights.
    *   **Limitations:** The Commonwealth cannot legislate beyond the scope of the treaty, the treaty must be genuine, and the power doesn't extinguish the state's residual power entirely.

**6. Courts' Ability to Make Law**

*   Courts make law through the **doctrine of precedent** and **statutory interpretation** when determining cases.
*   **Doctrine of Precedent:**
    *   **Definition:** A rule where judges must follow the legal reasoning ('ratio decidendi') of decisions made by higher courts in the same court hierarchy when deciding cases with similar material facts ('stare decisis' - to stand by what has been decided).
    *   **Court Hierarchy:** Necessary for the doctrine to operate, determining which precedents are binding.
    *   **Binding Precedent:** The ratio decidendi of a higher court that *must* be followed by lower courts in the same hierarchy when material facts are similar.
    *   **Persuasive Precedent:** Legal reasoning that is not binding but can influence a judge's decision. Can come from courts in other hierarchies, lower courts, courts of the same standing, or obiter dictum.
    *   **Obiter Dictum:** Comments made 'by the way' in a judgment that are not part of the ratio decidendi but can be persuasive precedent.
    *   **Avoiding/Changing Precedent (RODD):**
        *   **Reversing:** A higher court changes the decision of a lower court in the *same case* on appeal. The original decision is no longer precedent.
        *   **Overruling:** A higher court changes a precedent set by a lower court (or a court of the same standing) in a *different, later case*. The old precedent is no longer valid.
        *   **Distinguishing:** A court finds the material facts of the current case are sufficiently different from a case where a binding precedent was set, allowing the court to not follow that precedent.
        *   **Disapproving:** A court expresses disagreement with a precedent from a higher court or a court of the same standing but is still bound to follow it (obiter dictum). This doesn't change the precedent but can highlight the need for reform.
*   **Statutory Interpretation:**
    *   **Definition:** The process where courts give meaning to words or phrases in legislation when applying it to a case.
    *   **Reasons:** Needed when words/phrases are ambiguous, undefined, or their meaning has changed over time, or to apply legislation to unforeseen circumstances not considered during drafting.
    *   **Effects:**
        *   Creates precedent: The interpretation sets a precedent for how that legislation is applied in future cases.
        *   Broadens or narrows statutes: The interpretation can expand or restrict the scope and application of the legislation.
        *   Prompts legislative change: Court decisions interpreting statutes can highlight issues or gaps, prompting Parliament to amend the law.

**7. Factors Affecting the Ability of Courts to Make Law**

*   Several factors influence how effectively courts can make law:
    *   **The Doctrine of Precedent:** Limits courts as they must wait for a relevant case to be brought before them. Judges are restricted to making comments relevant to the case (ratio decidendi). Finding relevant precedents can be timely and costly. Lower courts must follow binding precedent even if they disagree.
    *   **Judicial Conservatism vs Judicial Activism:**
        *   **Judicial Conservatism:** Reluctance to make new law, viewing it as Parliament's role. Tend to interpret laws narrowly. Can limit law reform.
        *   **Judicial Activism:** Willingness to develop common law and consider social/political factors. May interpret laws more broadly. Can lead to significant legal changes (e.g., Mabo). Can be seen as undemocratic or lead to uncertainty.
    *   **Costs and Time in Bringing a Case to Court:**
        *   **Costs:** Legal representation, court fees, jury fees can be very high, particularly in higher courts. This can deter individuals from pursuing cases, limiting the opportunities for courts to make law. VLA support is limited.
        *   **Time:** Cases can take months or years due to preparation, lengthy trials, and backlogs. Delays can deter litigants.
    *   **The Requirement for Standing:** A party must be directly affected by the issue or have a 'special interest' to bring a case.
        *   **Effect:** Ensures cases are brought by genuinely affected parties but can prevent public interest cases where no single person is uniquely impacted. Limits who can initiate action, potentially meaning important issues aren't challenged.

**8. Relationship between Courts and Parliament**

*   Courts and Parliament have a complementary relationship in law-making.
    *   **Supremacy of Parliament:** Parliament is the supreme law-making body within its jurisdiction. It can make or change any law within its power. Parliament can **abrogate (override)** most common law made by courts. This ensures parliamentary laws reflect community values. Parliament cannot abrogate High Court decisions on constitutional matters.
    *   **Ability of Courts to Influence Parliament:** Court decisions, particularly those highlighting issues with existing law or suggesting reform in obiter dictum, can **influence Parliament** to change the law. Cases can raise public awareness and prompt legislative action.
    *   **Codification of Common Law:** Parliament can **codify (affirm)** common law principles developed by courts by passing legislation that incorporates them. This makes the law more certain and reinforces the common law principle. The *Native Title Act 1993 (Cth)* codified the High Court's decision in the *Mabo Case (No. 2)*.
    *   **Abrogation of Common Law:** Parliament can override judge-made law by passing statutes that conflict with it. This is done when Parliament disagrees with a common law decision or believes it is outdated.
