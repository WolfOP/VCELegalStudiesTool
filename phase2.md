# Phase 2 Development Update & Completion Guide  
**VCE Legal Studies Interactive Study Hub**  
**Date:** June 1, 2025

---

## I. Overview of Phase 2 Implementation

Phase 2 focused on:
- Addressing critical bugs identified after Phase 1
- Implementing the next set of interactive tools for the Key Skills Hub within Unit 4, Area of Study 1 (U4AOS1)

---

## II. Features & Fixes Implemented in Phase 2 (Coding Complete)

### A. Bug Fixes

#### 1. Gemini API Error Handling (Task 2.1 - Client-Side)
- **Issue Addressed:**  
  “Sorry, couldn't fetch AI insights for this case. Error: Failed to execute 'text' on 'Response': body stream already read.”
- **Fix Implemented:**  
  The `callGeminiAPI` function in `keySkillsHub.js` was updated to correctly handle error responses from the proxy. It now reads the response body (either as JSON or text) only once, preventing the "body stream already read" error and ensuring more robust error message display.
- **Note:**  
  The “Proxy Error: 405 Method Not Allowed” is a server-side proxy configuration issue that you need to address on your deployment platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.). The client-side code is now better prepared to handle various responses from the proxy.

#### 2. U4AOS1 Main Content Accordion Behavior (Task 2.2)
- **Issue Addressed:**  
  Multiple main U4AOS1 content accordions (e.g., "Interactive Glossary," "Case Explorer") could be open simultaneously.
- **Fix Implemented:**  
  The accordion logic in `script.js` was refined. Now, when a main U4AOS1 content block accordion (specifically those directly within `#u4aos1-accordion-container` and following the `.u4aos1-content > .border > .accordion-toggle` structure) is opened, any other such main accordion will automatically close. This ensures only one primary tool/section is expanded at a time, improving focus and usability.  
  *Nested accordions (e.g., within the Key Skills Hub tools themselves) remain unaffected.*

### B. New Key Skills Hub Tools Implemented (U4AOS1)

#### Key Skill 3: Explain the law-making powers of state and Commonwealth parliaments, using examples  
**Tool Implemented (Task 2.3):** Power Classification Sort

- **Functionality:**
  - Presents a list of law-making areas (e.g., "Defence," "Education," "Taxation").
  - Users can drag and drop these areas into three distinct zones:  
    - **Exclusive Powers (Commonwealth Only)**
    - **Concurrent Powers (Shared - Cth & State)**
    - **Residual Powers (States Only)**
  - A "Check Classifications" button allows users to verify their answers.
  - Feedback is provided, highlighting correct and incorrect placements, and includes relevant constitutional references (e.g., s51, s52) for correctly placed items.
  - A "Reset Sort" button allows users to try the activity again with shuffled items.
- **File:** Logic primarily in `keySkillsHub.js` (`setupPowerSortGame`, drag/drop handlers, checking logic).

---

#### Key Skill 4: Analyse the relationship between parliament and courts  
**Tool Implemented (Task 2.4):** Relationship Quadrant Matcher

- **Functionality:**
  - Presents four fixed quadrants representing key aspects of the parliament-court relationship:
    - Supremacy of Parliament
    - Courts Influence Parliament
    - Parliament Codifies Common Law
    - Courts Interpret Statutes
  - A list of scenarios or descriptions illustrating these relationships is provided.
  - Users drag and drop each scenario into the quadrant it best represents.
  - A "Check Matches" button allows users to verify their answers.
  - Feedback is provided, highlighting correct and incorrect matches.
  - A "Reset Matcher" button allows users to try the activity again with shuffled scenarios.
- **File:** Logic primarily in `keySkillsHub.js` (`setupRelationshipMatcherGame`, drag/drop handlers, checking logic).

---

## III. User Actions Required to Complete Phase 2

While the coding for the above features is now in place, the following actions are crucial from your side to make these tools fully effective and to ensure the AI integration works:

### 1. Content Population for New Key Skills Hub Tools (**CRITICAL**)

#### Power Classification Sort  
- **File:** `keySkillsHub.js`  
- **Action:** Expand the `lawMakingAreasData` array.  
  - Add a comprehensive list of law-making areas relevant to the VCE Legal Studies curriculum.
  - Ensure each has the correct `id`, area description, `correctCategory` (exclusive, concurrent, or residual), and accurate `constitutionRef`.
  - The current 12 examples are a starting point.  
  - **Aim for 15–20 diverse examples** for a robust learning experience.

#### Relationship Quadrant Matcher  
- **File:** `keySkillsHub.js`  
- **Action:** Expand the `relationshipScenariosData` array.  
  - Add more varied and nuanced scenarios that clearly illustrate each of the four aspects of the parliament-court relationship.
  - The current 8 examples are a good start.  
  - **Aim for 12–16 scenarios.**

---

### 2. Server-Side Gemini API Proxy Configuration (**CRITICAL for AI Features**)

- **Action:** This is an external task for you on your chosen serverless platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
- **Verify/Implement:**
  - Ensure your deployed serverless proxy function (pointed to by `PROXY_ENDPOINT_URL` in `keySkillsHub.js`):
    - Correctly handles POST requests.
    - Securely uses your `GEMINI_API_KEY_SECRET` environment variable (**NEVER** hardcode the key in any client-side or repository code).
    - Includes necessary CORS headers in its response (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "*"`, or your specific GitHub Pages URL, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "POST, OPTIONS"`).
- **Test:**  
  After configuring, test the "Explain Further ✨" in the glossary and "Get AI Insights ✨" in the Case Explorer to confirm the 405 error is resolved and you are receiving responses from Gemini.

---

### 3. Ongoing Content Population for Existing Tools

- **Interactive Glossary:**  
  Continue populating `categorizedGlossaryData` in `keySkillsHub.js` (or `script.js` if it's still there) with all relevant terms and definitions for all 6 categories.

- **Case Explorer:**  
  Add comprehensive details for all relevant High Court cases to `window.caseExplorerData` in `script.js`.

- **Guided Answer Construction:**  
  Add more questions, VCAA task word checklists, and answer scaffolds/blanks to `guidedAnswerQuestions` in `script.js` (or `keySkillsHub.js`).

- **Case Deconstructor:**  
  Add more cases, their elements, jumbled snippets, impact areas, and related concepts to `caseDeConstructionData` in `script.js` (or `keySkillsHub.js`).

- **Term Match Game:**  
  Add more term/definition pairs to `termMatchData` in `keySkillsHub.js` (or `script.js`).

- **Practice Questions Section:**  
  Add more questions and detailed answer points.

---

### 4. Testing and Feedback

- Thoroughly test all implemented features, especially the newly added Key Skills Hub tools and the accordion behavior.
- Provide feedback on any bugs, usability issues, or areas for UI/UX refinement.

---

## IV. Next Steps (Phase 3 & Beyond)

Once Phase 2 is fully completed (including content population and proxy setup), we will move on to:
- Implementing the remaining Key Skills Hub tools as outlined in the Development Plan and PRD
- Content development for Unit 3 and Unit 4 AOS 2

**By completing the user actions above, especially the content population and server-side proxy setup, the VCE Legal Studies Interactive Study Hub will become a significantly more powerful and complete resource.**

---

## What You Need To Do Next (Phase 3: Content Population & Preparation for Phase 4)

### **A. Populate Data for Key Skills Hub Tools (in `keySkillsHub.js`):**

- **Power Classification Sort:**  
  - Expand the `lawMakingAreasData` array.  
  - Add a wide range of law-making areas with their correct `id`, area description, `correctCategory` (exclusive, concurrent, or residual), and accurate `constitutionRef`.  
  - **Aim for 15–20+ diverse examples.**

- **Relationship Quadrant Matcher:**  
  - Expand the `relationshipScenariosData` array.  
  - Add more varied and nuanced scenarios illustrating each of the four aspects of the parliament-court relationship.  
  - **Aim for 12–16+ scenarios.**

- **Scenario Term Challenge (Skill 1):**  
  - Expand the `scenarioTermChallenges` array with more scenarios, multiple-choice options, and correct answers/explanations.

- **Source Analysis Challenge (Skill 2):**  
  - Expand the `sourceAnalysisChallenges` array with more legal excerpts, analytical questions, and relevant keywords for feedback.

---

### **B. Populate Data for Other U4AOS1 Interactive Tools:**

- **Interactive Glossary:**  
  - Thoroughly populate the `categorizedGlossaryData` object with all relevant terms and definitions for all 6 categories.  
  - Ensure category names in the JS object match the div IDs in `index.html` (e.g., `"The Australian Constitution"` maps to `glossaryCategory-the-australian-constitution`).

- **Case Explorer:**  
  - Add comprehensive details (facts, issue, decision, significance) for all relevant High Court cases to the `window.caseExplorerData` object.

- **Guided Answer Construction:**  
  - Add more practice questions, VCAA task word checklists, and detailed answer scaffolds/blanks to the `guidedAnswerQuestions` array.

- **Case Deconstructor:**  
  - Add more cases, their deconstructed elements (facts, issue, etc.), jumbled snippets for options, impact areas, and related concepts to the `caseDeConstructionData` array.

- **Term Match Game:**  
  - Add significantly more term/definition pairs to the `termMatchData` array.

- **Practice Questions Section:**  
  - Add a comprehensive list of practice questions with detailed model answer points.

---

### **C. Server-Side Gemini API Proxy Configuration (Reiteration - CRITICAL for AI Features):**

- Ensure your deployed serverless proxy function is:
  - Correctly handling POST requests
  - Using your secret `GEMINI_API_KEY_SECRET` environment variable
  - Has proper CORS headers
- Test the "Explain Further ✨" in the glossary and "Get AI Insights ✨" in the Case Explorer.

---

### **D. Thorough Testing and Feedback:**

- As you populate content, test all implemented features extensively.
- Note any bugs, usability issues, or areas where the UI/UX could be improved. Your feedback will be valuable for future refinement.

---

## V. Looking Ahead: Phase 4 & Beyond

Once you've made significant progress on content population in Phase 3 and the existing tools are well-stocked and tested, we can move to Phase 4, which involves:
- Implementing the remaining interactive tools for the Key Skills Hub (Skills 5–9)
- Developing informational content and interactive tools for Unit 3 and Unit 4 AOS 2
- Continuously enhancing UI/UX and feedback mechanisms

**The successful completion of Phase 3 (content population) by you is essential for the Study Hub to achieve its educational goals. The more comprehensive and accurate the content you add, the more beneficial this tool will be.**

---

**Please take the time to work through the content population tasks. It's a significant undertaking, but it will bring the Study Hub to life!  
Let me know when you've made good progress on Phase 3 and are ready to discuss starting the coding for the next set of features from Phase 4 (e.g., the "Inconsistency Resolver" for s109). We can work in parallel – you can populate content while I prepare the next features.**
