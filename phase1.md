# Phase 1 Development Summary: VCE Legal Studies Interactive Study Hub

**Date:** May 31, 2025

## Objective of Phase 1

The primary goal of Phase 1 was to stabilize the core functionality of the **Unit 4 Area of Study 1 (U4AOS1)** section of the VCE Legal Studies Interactive Study Hub. This involved addressing critical bugs that were preventing users from accessing and interacting with the various informational sections and tools within U4AOS1.

## Key Tasks Completed in Phase 1

### 1. Debugged U4AOS1 Tool Navigation Buttons

**Issue Addressed:**
- The set of buttons within the U4AOS1 section (e.g., "Parliament & Constitution," "Interactive Glossary," "Key Skills Hub," etc.) were not correctly showing their respective content panes or hiding the others when clicked.
- The active styling for the selected button was also not consistently applied.

**Actions Taken & Fixes Implemented:**
- **Reviewed and Revised `script.js`:**
  - The `handleU4AOS1ContentToggle` function in `script.js` was carefully reviewed and updated. This function is responsible for managing the visibility of the different content sections (`.u4aos1-content`) and applying active styles to the corresponding toggle buttons (`.u4aos1-content-toggle`).
- **Ensured Correct Event Listener Attachment:**
  - Verified that the click event listeners were correctly attached to all `.u4aos1-content-toggle` buttons and that these listeners properly called the `handleU4AOS1ContentToggle` function.
- **Scoped within DOMContentLoaded:**
  - Confirmed that all relevant JavaScript logic for these buttons was correctly placed within the main `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to ensure the HTML elements were available when the script ran.
- **Default Content Display:**
  - The logic for displaying a default tool/content section when U4AOS1 is first activated (either by direct navigation or as a default view when Unit 4 is selected) was refined for better reliability. This included ensuring the `initializeToolIfNeeded()` helper function correctly calls the initialization functions for the specific tools (like `window.setupCategorizedGlossary()` or `window.initializeKeySkillsHub()`).

**Outcome:**
- The U4AOS1 tool navigation buttons should now function as expected. Clicking a button will display its associated content section while hiding others, and the clicked button will receive appropriate active styling.

### 2. Resolved Glossary Category ID Mismatch

**Issue Addressed:**
- The categorized interactive glossary was failing to populate terms under their respective categories, and console errors like `Could not find div for category: glossaryCategory-the-australian-constitution` were appearing. This was due to a mismatch between the `id` attributes specified in the `index.html` for the category divs and the ids that the JavaScript function `setupCategorizedGlossary` (in `keySkillsHub.js`) was dynamically trying to find.

**Actions Taken & Fixes Implemented:**
- **Aligned HTML `id` Attributes:**
  - The `id` attributes of the category div elements within the `<div id="categorizedGlossaryContainer">` in `index.html` were corrected to precisely match the IDs generated by the JavaScript logic.
  - For example, `id="glossaryCategory-constitution"` was changed to `id="glossaryCategory-the-australian-constitution"`. This was done for all 6 defined glossary categories.
- **JavaScript `setupCategorizedGlossary()` Review:**
  - The JavaScript function in `keySkillsHub.js` responsible for populating the glossary was confirmed to generate these corrected IDs (e.g., by converting category names to lowercase, replacing spaces with hyphens, and removing special characters, or by using an explicit mapping). The provided `keySkillsHub.js` uses a `categoryMappings` object for robust ID matching.

**Outcome:**
- With the HTML ids and JavaScript expectations aligned, the categorized glossary should now populate correctly, with terms appearing under their intended thematic headings. The "Could not find div for category" console errors related to this issue should be resolved.

## Current Status Post-Phase 1

- The core navigation within the U4AOS1 section is now expected to be stable and functional.
- The categorized glossary structure is in place and should be populating correctly (pending full data entry by the user).
- The foundation is now more solid for proceeding with the implementation of further interactive tools for the Key Skills Hub (Phase 2) and other planned features.

## Next Steps

- Proceed with Phase 2, focusing on implementing the **Power Classification Sort** and **Relationship Quadrant Matcher** tools for the Key Skills Hub.
- Continued content population by the user remains a critical ongoing task.
