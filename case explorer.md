* **R v Brislan; Ex parte Williams (1935)**: This case involved the interpretation of "other like services" in **section 51(v)** of the Australian Constitution. The High Court determined that broadcasting to a wireless set fell within this power. Its significance is that it **changed the division of law-making powers** by extending the Commonwealth's power to include radio broadcasting and influenced later decisions on new communication technologies. The Commonwealth now relies on this interpretation to legislate on broadcasting and potentially the internet. The case name includes "ex parte Williams" because Williams was the party who challenged the law's validity.  
* **Commonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam case) (1983)**: The High Court interpreted the words "**external affairs**" in **section 51(xxix)** of the Constitution. The Court held that this power allows the Commonwealth to legislate to fulfil obligations under international treaties, such as the World Heritage Convention. This decision meant the Commonwealth could legislate on areas traditionally considered state residual powers, leading to a **shift in the division of law-making powers** towards the Commonwealth. The decision meant the Tasmanian law was inconsistent with the Commonwealth law and invalid under section 109\.  
* **McBain v Victoria (2000)**: This case is highlighted as a pertinent example of how **section 109** of the Australian Constitution operates. It involved a conflict between a Victorian law restricting IVF access for single women and the Commonwealth *Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth)* which prohibited discrimination based on marital status. The High Court found the Victorian law inconsistent with the Commonwealth law and therefore invalid to that extent.  
* **Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1992)**: The High Court interpreted **sections 7 and 24** of the Constitution, which require members of parliament to be "directly chosen by the people". The Court recognised an **implied right to freedom of political communication** necessary for representative government.  
* **Roach v Electoral Commissioner (2007)**: Also interpreting **sections 7 and 24** of the Constitution, this case challenged a Commonwealth law banning all sentenced prisoners from voting. The High Court held that while the right to vote is not an absolute implied right, the complete ban was inconsistent with the principle of representative government and unconstitutional. It affirmed that removing the right to vote must be for significant reasons, like serving a long prison sentence.  
* **Mabo v Queensland (No. 2\) (1992)**: This landmark case overturned the common law principle of *terra nullius* and recognised the existence of **native title** for Indigenous Australians who maintained a connection to their traditional land. The decision was later codified by the Commonwealth Parliament in the *Native Title Act 1993 (Cth)*. The sources mention this as an example of judicial activism.  
* **Cole v Whitfield (1988)**: This case interpreted **section 92** of the Constitution, which states that interstate trade and commerce "shall be absolutely free". The Court held that section 92 prevents discriminatory or protectionist laws against interstate trade, but allows non-discriminatory burdens. The Tasmanian law on crayfish size was found not to be protectionist.  
* **Goryl v Greyhound Australia Pty Ltd (1994)**: Interpreting **section 117** of the Constitution, which prevents discrimination based on state of residence. The High Court found a Queensland law limiting damages for non-residents injured in the state discriminated based on residence and was invalid.  
* **Brown v R (1986)**: This case interpreted **section 80** of the Constitution, guaranteeing trial by jury for Commonwealth indictable offences. The High Court held that this right is mandatory for Commonwealth indictable offences and cannot be waived.  
* **Carr v State of Western Australia (2007)**: The High Court interpreted the term "**interview**" in Western Australian legislation regarding the videotaping of admissions. The Court gave a broad interpretation, defining "interview" as any conversation between police and a suspect, making the cell conversation admissible evidence.  
* **Palmer v State of Western Australia (2021)**: This case challenged WA's COVID-19 border closures, partly referencing **section 92** (interstate trade). The High Court rejected the challenge, providing a narrower interpretation of section 92 in this context, stating it does not apply to necessary, non-discriminatory public health measures.  
* **State Insurance Commission v Trigwell (1979)**: The High Court applied an older common law precedent but, in its *obiter dictum*, expressed disapproval, suggesting parliament should make law in this area. This demonstrates how courts can influence parliament to make law.  
* **Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth (1951)**: This case involved a challenge to a Commonwealth law dissolving the Communist Party. The High Court declared the law invalid, highlighting the role of the **judiciary** in checking parliamentary power as part of the separation of powers.  
* **Koowarta v. Bjelke-Petersen (1982)**: Mentioned in the context of the external affairs power (s51(xxix)), where the Chief Justice expressed concern about unlimited legislative power if the Commonwealth could legislate to give effect to *every* international agreement. Also mentioned in relation to section 109\.  
* **Jones v The Commonwealth (No 2\) (1965)**: Mentioned as being influenced by the *Brislan* case, where the High Court decided that television broadcasts also fit within the scope of section 51(v). This reinforced the broad interpretation of the Commonwealth's power over communication technologies.  
* **Croome v. Tasmania (1997)**: This case involved a challenge to Tasmanian laws criminalising homosexual acts, arguing inconsistency with Commonwealth human rights legislation based on an international covenant (via the external affairs power). The High Court applied **section 109** to invalidate the relevant sections of the Tasmanian law. The significance was that a residual power became concurrent, increasing Commonwealth power.  
* **Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997)**: This case further developed the concept of the implied right to freedom of political communication derived from **sections 7 and 24**. The High Court established a test to determine if a law infringes upon this implied freedom.  
* **ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (2009)**: This case involved the interpretation of "acquisition of property on just terms" under **section 51(xxxi)** of the Constitution. The High Court clarified the scope of "acquisition," distinguishing it from "deprivation" of property rights.  
* **McCloy v NSW (2015)**: Mentioned as expanding the test developed in *Lange* for determining whether a law infringes upon the implied freedom of political communication.   
* **R v Brislan; Ex parte Williams (1935)**: This case required the High Court to interpret the meaning of "other like services" in **section 51(v)** of the Australian Constitution, which gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws regarding "postal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like services". The challenge was to the **validity of the *Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 (Cth)***, which required owners of wireless sets to hold a licence. The High Court decided that broadcasting to a wireless set fell within the scope of section 51(v) as a form of telephonic service or a 'like service', thus validating the Commonwealth law. Its **significance** lies in **extending the Commonwealth Parliament's law-making power** to include broadcasting to a wireless set, resulting in a shift in the division of powers towards the Commonwealth. This case also influenced later decisions regarding other communication technologies like television and, arguably, the internet.

* **Commonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam case) (1983)**: The High Court interpreted the words "**external affairs**" in **section 51(xxix)** of the Constitution. The dispute arose when the Tasmanian government planned to build a dam on the Gordon River, an area listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The Commonwealth Parliament passed legislation prohibiting the dam based on its obligations under the World Heritage Convention, an international treaty Australia had signed. The High Court held that the external affairs power gives the Commonwealth Parliament the power to **legislate to fulfil its obligations under international treaties**, even in areas traditionally considered residual state powers. This decision resulted in a **shift in the division of law-making powers from the states to the Commonwealth**.

* **McBain v Victoria (2000)**: This case involved a conflict between **Victorian legislation** (the *Infertility Treatment Act 1995 (Vic)*) which restricted access to IVF treatment for single women, and **Commonwealth legislation** (the *Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth)*) which prohibited discrimination based on marital status when providing services. The High Court found the Victorian law to be inconsistent with the Commonwealth law and therefore **invalid to the extent of the inconsistency under section 109** of the Australian Constitution. This case is highlighted as a pertinent example of how section 109 operates to resolve inconsistencies between state and Commonwealth laws.

* **Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1992)**: The High Court interpreted **sections 7 and 24** of the Constitution, which state that members of Parliament are "directly chosen by the people". The case challenged a Commonwealth law that prohibited television advertising during election campaigns. The High Court recognised an **implied right to freedom of political communication** as fundamental to the principle of representative government established by sections 7 and 24\. The Commonwealth law was **declared invalid** for infringing upon this implied right.

* **Roach v Electoral Commissioner (2007)**: This case also involved the interpretation of **sections 7 and 24** of the Constitution. It challenged the constitutional validity of a Commonwealth law that banned all sentenced prisoners from voting in federal elections. The High Court held that while the right to vote is not an absolute implied right, it is a **structural protection necessary for representative government**. The complete ban on all prisoners was found to be inconsistent with this principle and therefore unconstitutional. The decision affirmed that removing the right to vote can only be done for significant reasons, such as serving a long prison sentence.

* **Mabo v Queensland (No. 2\) (1992)**: This landmark case saw the High Court overturn the common law principle of ***terra nullius*** (land belonging to no one) which had been applied to Australia since British colonisation. The Court recognised the **existence of native title** for Indigenous Australians who maintained a connection to their traditional land, provided it had not been extinguished by a subsequent transaction. This decision established a new common law principle and was later codified by the Commonwealth Parliament in the *Native Title Act 1993 (Cth)*.

* **Cole v Whitfield (1988)**: This case involved the interpretation of **section 92** of the Constitution, which states that trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States "shall be absolutely free". The case examined a Tasmanian law concerning the legal size of crayfish imported from South Australia. The High Court held that section 92 prevents laws that are **discriminatory or protectionist against interstate trade**, but laws that impose legitimate burdens, such as conservation measures, are permissible. The Tasmanian law was found not to breach section 92 because its purpose was conservation, not discrimination.

* **Goryl v Greyhound Australia Pty Ltd (1994)**: The High Court interpreted **section 117** of the Constitution, which prevents discrimination against residents of another state. The case concerned a Queensland law that limited the damages a non-resident injured in Queensland could recover, based on the laws of their state of residence. The High Court held that the law **discriminated based on state of residence** and was therefore invalid under section 117, affirming a wide interpretation of this right.

* **Brown v R (1986)**: This case interpreted **section 80** of the Constitution, which guarantees a trial by jury for Commonwealth indictable offences. The High Court held that this is an "imperative and indispensable requirement" and the **right to a trial by jury for a Commonwealth indictable offence cannot be waived**, even if state law permits judge-alone trials.

* **AON Risk Services Aust Ltd v ANU (2009)**: The High Court **overruled its own previous decision** in *Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd (1997)*. The case concerned whether a party could make significant amendments to their case late in the process. The High Court agreed that allowing substantial amendments could disadvantage the other party.

* **Carr v State of Western Australia (2007)**: The High Court interpreted the term "**interview**" in **Western Australian legislation** (*Criminal Code*) regarding the videotaping of admissions of guilt for serious offences. The Court gave a **broad interpretation**, defining "interview" as any conversation between police and a suspect, making a video recording of a cell conversation admissible evidence. This broadened the application of the statute.

* **Palmer v State of Western Australia (2021)**: This case challenged Western Australia's border closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, partly based on **section 92** of the Constitution (interstate trade and commerce). The High Court unanimously rejected the argument, providing a **narrower interpretation** of section 92 and clarifying that it does not apply to necessary, non-discriminatory public health restrictions.

* **Attorney-General (Cth) v Kevin and Jennifer (2003)**: This case, heard in the Family Court but relevant to principles confirmed by the High Court, involved the interpretation of the word "**man**" in the *Marriage Act 1961 (Cth)*. The Court held that the word should be given a **contemporary meaning**, including a person born female who has undergone gender reassignment surgery, thus validating the marriage.

* **State Insurance Commission v Trigwell (1979)**: The High Court applied an older common law precedent regarding a landowner's liability for animals straying onto highways but, in its *obiter dictum*, expressed **disapproval** of the precedent as outdated and suggested that **law-making in this area should be left to parliament**. This case demonstrates how courts can signal a need for legislative change.

* **Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth (1951)**: This case challenged a Commonwealth law that dissolved the Communist Party. The High Court declared the law **invalid**, ruling that the Commonwealth Parliament did not have the power to ban a political party. This case highlights the role of the **independent judiciary**, as part of the separation of powers, in checking parliamentary law-making.
